  # These datasets should produce a geometry collection and not a polygon only
  # dataset. If the algorithm is fixed, a new test should be introduced to
  # check this behavior.
  # This test should stay in place because for shapefiles there should always
  # be a polygon result created since it does not support geometry collections.
