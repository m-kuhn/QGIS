/**
 * \ingroup core
 * \class QgsTask
 * \brief Abstract base class for long running background tasks. Tasks can be controlled directly,
 * or added to a QgsTaskManager for automatic management.
 *
 * Derived classes should implement the process they want to execute in the background
 * within the run() method. This method will be called when the
 * task commences (ie via calling start() ).
 *
 * Long running tasks should periodically check the isCancelled() flag to detect if the task
 * has been cancelled via some external event. If this flag is true then the task should
 * clean up and terminate at the earliest possible convenience.
 *
 * \note Added in version 3.0
